= Brandon's Dot Files
These are the dotfiles I use to setup a system the way I like it.  These are copied
shamelessly from {Ryan Bates}[http://www.github.com/ryanb/dotfiles] and are specific
to bash.

== Installation
  git clone git://github.com/bbeck/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install
